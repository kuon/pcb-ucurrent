# µcurrent board

This is my own PCB for the µcurrent board.

It is based on <https://www.eevblog.com/projects/ucurrent/>.

While the base idea is the same, a few things have been modified:

- There is a rotary switch which can support many different shunt resistor, 12
  in the current design.
- The power supply has been modified to use ±15V to give a greater range.
- The amplifier has been modified to match the power supply.
